    "\n",
    "**What Is Significance level?** The significance level, also known as alpha or Î±, is a measure of the strength of the evidence that must be present in your sample before you will reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the effect is statistically significant. [https://statisticsbyjim.com/glossary/significance-level/] Significance level defines how much evidence we require to reject Null hypothesis (H0) in favor of Alternative hypothesis (HA). It serves as the cutoff. The default cutoff commonly used is 0.05. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject H0. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, we do not reject H0.

    "**Null hypothesis (often denoted H0)** the subject cannot tell if the cup had milk in it first or last.\n",
