### 3.1 About the 

The challenge with the CAO Points Notebook was to 

### 3.2 What does the Setup at the beginning do?

- Imports to run the notebook
- A global timestamp of when the files are extracted and saved. 
- Test functions.
    - Check availability of the 
    - Save the webpage and track changes
    - Save all files to a folder
- Webpage links used for the assessment
    - Using the saved webpage the HTML could be inspected to extract the links with required data 
-  URL
    - After inspecting the URLs a list of all links to the files used in the project are set here.

### 2.3 The ETL Process?
This demonstrates how a data analyst should use the extract, transform, load (ETL) process.
