# 1. GitHub Repository
GitHub repository contains the following

- 1.1 README.md 
    - This README.md file explains why the repository exists, what is in it, and how to run the notebooks
- 1.2 requirements.txt
    - A requirements.txt file is included to enable someone to quickly run these notebooks with minimal configuration.
- 1.3 Exercise Folder
    - The Exercise Folder contains Jupyter notebook for
        - 01_statistics_exercise.ipynb 
        - 02-models_exercise.ipynb
        - 
- 1.4 Anomaly_detection.ipynb
    - Jupyter notebook for Anomaly Detection using Keras
- 1.5 Version Control
    - A version control to keep track of changes made to the Jupyter notebooks and learning outcomes.
- 1.6 data
    - Pictures for notebooks
    - Anomaly_detection.ipynb also uses the data folder to read 2018 and 2019 data and save files HTML, pdf and xlsx.  
- 1.7 Coursework
    - Lecturers Jupyter notebook for the Exercises

# 2. Exercise Folder
This README contains an overview of the two notebooks. The Jupyter notebook contains the main body of work and lists all references used in the assignment.

### 3.1 About the 

The challenge with the CAO Points Notebook was to 

### 3.2 What does the Setup at the beginning do?

- Imports to run the notebook
- A global timestamp of when the files are extracted and saved. 
- Test functions.
    - Check availability of the 
    - Save the webpage and track changes
    - Save all files to a folder
- Webpage links used for the assessment
    - Using the saved webpage the HTML could be inspected to extract the links with required data 
-  URL
    - After inspecting the URLs a list of all links to the files used in the project are set here.

### 2.3 The ETL Process?
This demonstrates how a data analyst should use the extract, transform, load (ETL) process.

# 4. How to Install and Run the Assessment

- 4.1 Github
- 4.2 NBViewer
- 4.3 Try at home
- 4.4 Binder
     

### 4.1 Github
Review the assessment [Click here cao_V7.ipynb](https://github.com/DPR-droid/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2021/blob/master/cao_V7.ipynb) or [here for pyplot_V3.ipynb](https://github.com/DPR-droid/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2021/blob/master/pyplot_V3.ipynb)

### 4.2 NBViewer
NBViewer is another way to share Jupyter Notebook.

To view the cao_V7.ipynb click this badge →→  [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](http://nbviewer.org/github/DPR-droid/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2021/blob/master/cao_V7.ipynb)

To view the pyplot_V3.ipynb click the badge →→ [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](http://nbviewer.org/github/DPR-droid/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2021/blob/master/pyplot_V3.ipynb)

### 4.3 Try at home

To try this on your PC you require the following:
- Install Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual this distribution includes Python and several packages used in this Assignment including the NumPy package. 
- 'requirments.txt' for other modules required. 
- Install Jupyter https://jupyter.org/ to run cao_V7.ipynb and pyplot_V3.ipynb
- Install Github
- git clone git@github.com:DPR-droid/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-2021.git


### 4.4 Binder
Binder will not have a link in this project as the online virtual executable environment had several issues with loading imports from the requirments.txt file, see below:

    - urllib
    - re
    - warnings
    - time
    - zipfile

When removed from the requirments.txt file the online virtual executable environment would run but was unable to execute segments of the jupyter notebooks
