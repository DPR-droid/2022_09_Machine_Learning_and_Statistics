## 3.1 What did I learn?

**01_statistics_exercise.ipynb**
Fisher's exact test is a statistical test that is used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. By conducting a Fisher's exact test, you can learn whether there is a significant difference between the proportions of observations in different categories of the two variables being compared. For example, you might use Fisher's exact test some patients are given drug X and others are given drug Y. The second nominal variable is the outcome: patients are cured, or they are not.

Then using the python packages numpy and pandas to conduct a Fisher's exact test to perform the test and compute a p-value, which is a measure of the statistical significance of the association between the two variables.

**02-models_exercise.ipynb**
Mathematical modeling is the process of using mathematics and computational tools to represent and analyse real-world phenomena, systems, or processes. Through mathematical modeling, you can learn about the underlying structure and dynamics of a system, make predictions about its future behaviour, and develop strategies for controlling or manipulating it.

By using mathematical modeling, you can learn a wide range of information about a system, including:

- The relationships between different variables in the system and how they influence each other
- The trends and patterns in the system over time
- The underlying structure and dynamics of the system
- The sensitivity of the system to changes in input parameters or initial conditions
- The stability and robustness of the system
- The optimal strategies for controlling or manipulating the system

**03_parameters_exercise.ipynb**

Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression can be used to model relationships between variables that are not linear, allowing you to learn about the nonlinear relationships between the variables.

By using polynomial regression, you can learn about the functional form of the relationship between the variables, as well as the strength and significance of the relationship. You can also use polynomial regression to make predictions about the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable.

For example:

- The functional form of the relationship between the variables (e.g., whether it is a linear, quadratic, cubic, etc. relationship)
- The strength of the relationship between the variables (e.g., how well the model fits the data)
- The statistical significance of the relationship between the variables (e.g., whether the relationship is likely to be real or due to chance)
- The importance of different terms in the polynomial equation (e.g., whether certain terms contribute significantly to the model)
- The prediction accuracy of the model for different values of the independent variable

# 4 Anomaly Detection using Keras Notebook - Anomaly_detection_V06.ipynb
This README contains an overview of the Anomaly_detection_V06 Notebook. The Jupyter notebook contains the main body of work and list all references used in the assignment.

## 4.1 What did I learn?

Documentation for any software library or framework can sometimes be challenging to understand, especially if you are new to the subject or if the documentation is poorly written. The documentation for the time series anomaly detection example provided in the Keras library is relatively concise and provides a good overview of the steps involved in building and training an autoencoder model for anomaly detection. This Anomaly_detection_V06.ipynb notebook is a reworking and will hopefully add the following:

1. Adding more detailed explanations and examples
2. Providing more context and background information
3. Adding more guidance on model evaluation and interpretation

As with any machine learning task, there are many technical details and concepts that need to be understood in order to successfully implement and use this example.
